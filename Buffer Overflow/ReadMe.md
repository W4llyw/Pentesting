These are the scripts that I use when performing buffer overflow attacks.
These scripts are skeletons that have to be modified to your current assesment, things like application and overflow data will have to be changed.

### Order of Operation
***
0. Spiking (this can be optional)
1. Fuzzing
2. Offset

5. Final
* Badchars can be done just about anytime before you start sending shellcode.
